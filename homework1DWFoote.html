<h1 style=text-align:center>CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1>
    <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
    <p><img style="float:left;" SRC="oldboat.gif" alt= "viking ship">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>
    <p>You will be need to change a little bit of the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested that make sense when reading the content.</p>
<p>This link provides a direct connectinon to a validator for HTML5.<br>
    <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/" target="blank" rel="noopener"> Visit this site and try your hand at validation! </a>
</p>
<p>Here is a second use to explain how to use the validator<br>
    <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/about.html" target="blank" rel="noopener">Read more here if you are interested in proper use of HTML5 validator!</a>

<h2>Validation is important for browser recognition</h2>
<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>

  <h3>Use of HTML5 Section</h3>
  <p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
</section>

<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
    
<ul>
    <li> planning a web page</li>
    <li>studying the target audience</li>
    <li>following standards when coding</li>
</ul>     
<p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for this to work, make sure you validate your code!</p>

 <!-- In this Page I updated the areas the were requested. Including adding two hyperlinks, fixing an unordered list, and validating the code -->
